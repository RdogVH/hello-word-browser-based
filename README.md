# hello-word-browser-based
This repo is from the browser not the Windows App!

I'm also creating a repo in GetHub on my windows ssytem - that seems to have the files stored locally.
I don't know where these broswer based files live but at some point it needs to pull them onto my system to build unless this is always done via some form of CI?
